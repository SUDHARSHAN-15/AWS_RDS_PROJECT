# AWS_RDS_PROJECT
# AWS RDS Serverless Data Pipeline

This project demonstrates how to build a **serverless data ingestion and transformation pipeline** using **AWS Lambda**, **S3**, and **RDS (MySQL)**. The pipeline automates the process of cleaning, transforming, and loading CSV data into an RDS database whenever new files are uploaded to an S3 bucket.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
- **Amazon S3**: Stores incoming CSV files.
- **AWS Lambda**: Automatically triggers when a new file is uploaded, processes the data, and inserts it into RDS.
- **AWS RDS (MySQL)**: Serves as the persistent data store.
- **AWS IAM & VPC**: Ensure secure access control and private networking.
- **AWS CloudWatch**: Provides logging and monitoring for the entire pipeline.

## 🧠 Key Features
- Event-driven data pipeline using **S3 triggers** and **Lambda functions**.
- Automated **data cleaning and transformation** using Python.
- Secure architecture deployed within a **private VPC**.
- Centralized **monitoring and logging** via CloudWatch.
- Demonstrates **real-world AWS automation and integration** skills.
